# Plant Communication Signal Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying plant communication signals—such as Contentment, Distress, Invitation, and Warning—based on various bio-physiological features using supervised machine learning. The dataset includes synthetic records of 1000 plant instances with features like leaf vibration, root signal strength, and sunlight exposure. Several preprocessing steps were applied, including outlier removal, SMOTE for class balancing, and Gaussian noise injection to improve generalization. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and KNN were evaluated using hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV. The best performance was achieved in the third experimental setup, combining SMOTE and noise augmentation, where KNN reached an accuracy of 93.1%. The study demonstrates that integrating class balancing, noise injection, and tuning significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of plant message classification.
